    <p><h3>When did I start acting?</h3></p></p>
     </div>
    <div class="later">
    <p> I started acting in preschool. Every year there was a small production</p>
    <p>done by the oldest class in the school. I was in that oldest class and this year we were doing The moss covered rock. 
    <p>I imediately signed up for the deer with two of my friend and we spit the part three ways.</p>
    <p>I had three lines in that play but I have improved a lot. I went from 3 to 104.</p>
